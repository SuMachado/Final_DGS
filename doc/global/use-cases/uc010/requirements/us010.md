### 1.1. User Story Description

As administrator, I intend to specify a new vaccine type.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> For each type of vaccine, several vaccines might exist. For instance, for
the Covid-19 type, there is (i) the Pfizer vaccine, (ii) the Moderna vaccine, (iii) the AstraZeneca vaccine,
and so on. Although each vaccine demands a distinct administration process according to the age
group (e.g., number of doses, dosage in milliliters, time interval between doses). For now, the system
will not record this information.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** How do we characterize the vaccine types?
>  
> **Answer:** The vaccine types have a code, a short description and vaccine technology.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC01:** The Vaccine Type should have the following mandatory attributes: Code, Short Description and Vaccine Technology.

* **AC03:** The vaccine technology must be one of six types obtained from: https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/understanding_six_types_of_vaccine_technologies.
* **AC04:** The code must be unique for each vaccine type.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
