### 1.1. User Story Description

As nurse, I want to record the administration of a vaccine to an SNS user.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> After giving the vaccine, the nurse registers the event in the system, more precisely, she registers the vaccine type (e.g., Covid-19), vaccine name/brand (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca) and the lot number used. After that, the nurse sends the user to a recovery room, to stay there for a given recovery period (e.g., 30 minutes). If there are no problems, after the recovery period is over, the user should leave the vaccination center. If the nurse identifies any adverse reactions during the recovery period, she must record it in the system.
> The lot should be 14 characters numbers or letters, without special characters.
