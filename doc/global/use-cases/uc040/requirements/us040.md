### 1.1. User Story Description

As nurse, I intend to consult the users in the waiting room of a Healthcare Facility.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> At any time, a nurse responsible for administering the vaccine will use the application to check the list of SNS users that are present in the vaccination center to take the vaccine and will call one SNS user to administer him/her the vaccine. Usually, the user that has arrived firstly will be the first one to be vaccinated (like a FIFO queue). However, sometimes, due to operational issues, that might not happen. The nurse checks the user info and health conditions in the system and in accordance with the scheduled vaccine type, and the SNS user vaccination history, she gets system instructions regarding the vaccine to be administered (e.g.: vaccine and respective dosage). It's worth mentioning that only nurses are allowed to access all user’s health data.
>If it's not possible to give the vaccine, it's the receptionist who cancels de appointment.
>After being called he will go to another location, so yes, this queue should not “see" the user
