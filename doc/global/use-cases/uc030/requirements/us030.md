# US030 - User makes an appointment to get a vaccination

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.0. Primary Actor
SNS user

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an SNS user, I intend to use the application to schedule a vaccination.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

> The application's primary function is to facilitate the scheduling of vaccinations for SNS users. Users will utilize the application to arrange their vaccination appointments by providing essential information, including their SNS user number, preferred vaccination center, desired date and time for vaccination, and the preferred vaccine type (with a default suggestion related to the ongoing outbreak).

> Upon submission of these details, the application is expected to perform several key tasks. Firstly, it should verify the vaccination center's capacity for the specified date and time. Subsequently, if feasible, the application will confirm the scheduled vaccination appointment and notify the user, prompting them to attend the selected vaccination center at the appointed date and time.

> Additionally, certain user demographics, such as older individuals, may opt to schedule their vaccination appointments via a healthcare center with assistance from a receptionist. This alternate method will need to be accommodated within the application's functionality.
> An email is sent to the user as confirmation.
> As a general principle, an interval of 4â€“6 months between doses could be considered. We want this to be a configurable item in our system.
> If the users leaves, and we know he has left, we will mark the scheduled vaccination as "no show".
