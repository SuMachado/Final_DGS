| **Vaccine Technology**                 | Ever since the first vaccine was developed in 1796 to treat smallpox,1 several different methods have been created to develop successful vaccines.<br/>Today, those methods, known as vaccine technologies, are more advanced and use the latest technology to help protect the world from preventable diseases.<br/>Depending on the pathogen (a bacteria or virus) that is being targeted, different vaccine technologies are used to generate an effective vaccine.<br/>ust like there are multiple ways to develop a vaccine, they can also take on multiple forms—from needle injections and nasal sprays to oral doses, a more recent innovation.<br/> In total, there are six different vaccine technology platforms, each with its own benefits, and examples.<br/> The full specification can be obtained from https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/understanding_six_types_of_vaccine_technologies. |
